At current moment bot just show to new users two buttons, asking to press any. It will also auto-mute new user.

If none pressed, user will be kicked after timeout (and banned for short period, to avoid bots to autojoin). 
But, if new user press any, he will be unmuted.

Thats enough to defeat most of spambots at current moment. 
*It's also easy to make bot more clever.
